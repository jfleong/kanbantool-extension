# kanbantool-extension

This project is for anyone that is using an instance of [kanbantool][kanbantool]. 

The project currently can talk to the page that the extension is running on and populate the extension popup to display the columns and rows of your kanban board.

NOTE: It's still not totally functional but works in terms of communicating with the actual page and interacting with it's own popup

## Project Setup

## Running it

1. Open up chrome and open the extentions tab
2. Select the developer mode checkbox at the top right

5. Navigate to your kanbantool page (ie http://mycompany.kanbantool.com)
6. You should see the extension popup in the omnibar on the right
7. Currently (version 0.0) this will list all workflow options and swimlane options available.  Debating what to do next with it.
